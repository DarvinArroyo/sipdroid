= Illegal Usage of Sipdroid by Gizmo, Inc. =

== Existing Violations ==

Gizmo5 publishes Guava which is based on Sipdroid.

  * No source code is offered on their [http://gizmo5.com/guava download site].
  * The copyright message accessible after program start has been removed.
  * Their [http://nosimcard.blogspot.com/ blog] does not give any credits to Sipdroid.

== Warning ==

Don't install guava.apk from their site, not even for testing. Since it is not listed in the Android Market, it might easily contain malicious code infecting your device. A company that disrespects copyright laws is very likely to harm you in other ways, too!

== Protecting our Rights ==

  * Sent Email to Gizmo5

Dear sirs,

you published "Guava" in violation of the GNU public license.

Furthermore you removed the copyright notice. This is violating copyright laws.

This is highly abominable because you're stealing intellectual property. Please stop immediately. We will inform legal authorities.

  * Sent takedown notice under the DMCA to Google Android team

http://sipdroid.googlecode.com/svn/images/gizmo_copyright_violation.png

  * Sent GPL violation reports to [http://gpl-violations.org] and [http://fsfe.org/projects/ftf/reporting-fixing-violations.en.html Freedom Task Force (FTF)]

== Reactions ==

  * Gizmo has not yet replied to our Email.
  * Michael Robertson, founder of Gizmo5, replied on his [http://guava.uservoice.com/pages/23533-guava-/suggestions/263364-make-the-source-code-available-for-download Guava Feedback Forum]. He provided a [http://gizmo5.com/guava.tgz download link] for the modified source.

== Claims ==

Users should not have to jump thru five hoops if they want to get the source code. For taking intellectual property from an open source project it is expected to:

  * Mention the original authors right away. In this case only after downloading and completing 5 required of about 10 settings, the menu and copyright box get accessible.
  * Offer sources and binary in the same place.
