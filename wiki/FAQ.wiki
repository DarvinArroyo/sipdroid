== How can I prepare for mobile VoIP? ==

Sipdroid allows you to choose where you will use VoIP, on WLANs only, on 3G, or EDGE networks. If you are going to use VoIP services outside private wireless networks, it's your responsibility to check the contractual terms with the mobile operator:

Often mobile phone operators forbid using VoIP in the contract's fine print. The European Union is already looking at whether blocks on VoIP service by Europe's mobile phone operators might breach competition laws.

The following plans are suitable for unlimited hotspot/3G usage:

== What type of warranty comes with Sipdroid? ==

After completion of the closed alpha stage this project will publish the software for free under the terms of [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html GNU General Public License v3]. The first beta version will be for software testing. So please allow for some issues and incompatibilities at the beginning.

== How can I dial my contacts over IP / over PSTN? ==

In settings you can specify your preferred call type. This is used when clicking a "Call" tab of a contact. When clicking on the "Text" tab of a contact you get a menu like this:

"Messaging" lets you proceed with sending SMS/MMS. The other two let you override your call type manually.

== How can I dial a phone number over IP / over PSTN? ==

When entering a phone number in the dialer add a "#" sign to toggle call type. If your preferred call type is SIP adding a # behind the number calls over PSTN.

NOTE: Don't add anything to emergency numbers. They are always dialed over PSTN.

== What SIP providers is Sipdroid compatible with? ==

Sipdroid runs standard SIP. At the moment registering to a virtual PBX as offered by [http://pbxes.org pbxes.org] is required to get good speech quality and full interoperability. [http://pbxes.org pbxes.org] is a free service. From there register your SIP accounts.

== Is a PBXes account required? ==

No, you can enter any SIP account. But presently this will limit you to just outgoing calls, poor voice in send direction, or battery draining issues. So we strongly recommend using the proxy service of [http://pbxes.org pbxes.org]. In the future other providers will probably improve their services to directly support Sipdroid, or Sipdroid might also support more by new ideas or operating system features when they become available.

== What advantages do I get by signing up for [http://pbxes.org pbxes.org]? ==

  * It suppliers a full features PBX to you for multiple extensions. It's not a telephony service provider. You can register several trunks to use multiple telephony service providers of your choice.
  * [http://pbxes.org pbxes.org] allows for handoff of calls between networks.
  * Support NAT (network address translation).
  * It's free.
  * [http://pbxes.org pbxes.org] can screen anonymous callers for you.

== Is it complicated to set up a virtual PBX? ==

Please have a look at the DOCS section on the [http://pbxes.org pbxes.org] website. Under "Getting started" you find an introduction to the necessary steps. First you create extension(s) and trunk(s). Then you must add at least one inbound and one outbound route.

== What build environment is needed for Sipdroid? ==

The program will be downloadable for installation from this website. If you are interested in contributing to the project please install [http://developer.android.com/sdk/1.1_r1/installing.html Eclipse] and [http://subclipse.tigris.org/install.html Subclipse] for building the source code.
