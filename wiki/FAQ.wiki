== Prerequisites ==

=== How can I prepare for mobile VoIP? ===

Sipdroid allows you to choose where you will use VoIP, on WLANs only, on 3G, or EDGE networks. If you are going to use VoIP services outside private wireless networks, it's your responsibility to check the contractual terms with the mobile operator:

Often mobile phone operators forbid using VoIP in the contract's fine print. The European Union is already looking at whether blocks on VoIP service by Europe's mobile phone operators might breach competition laws.

The following plans are suitable for unlimited hotspot/3G usage:

=== What type of warranty comes with Sipdroid? ===

This project publishes Sipdroid for free under the terms of [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html GNU General Public License v3]. The first public version is beta for software testing. So please allow for some issues and incompatibilities at the beginning.

=== How much will Sipdroid drain the battery? (Constantly running Internet connection?) ===

When using [http://pbxes.org pbxes.org] the expected stand-by times are the same as without Sipdroid running in the background (we observed about three days of stand-by time).

=== How much bandwidth is required? ===

Sipdroid uses G.711 A-law to transmit voice which needs about 80 kBit/s in each direction. This corresponds to a total of 1.2 MB per minute.

A video call needs approximately twice as much.

=== What are the system requirements? ===

To install Sipdroid you need version 1.5 "Cupcake" of Android.

See http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/04/android-15-is-here.html for details on updating the OS on developer phones.

The update for the other phones comes over the air, starting May 1st, 2009.

=== What does "full" version mean? ===

There is a download at Android Market which is limited to usage within Wireless LANs only. 

The download available [http://code.google.com/p/sipdroid/downloads/list here] can be used on 3G and EDGE networks as well. Please check the contractual terms with your mobile operator before using that one (see above).

Upgrading through Android Market always reverts to the limited version.

=== What build environment is needed for Sipdroid? ===

If you are interested in developing and contributing to the project please install [http://developer.android.com/sdk/1.1_r1/installing.html Eclipse] and [http://subclipse.tigris.org/install.html Subclipse] for building the source code.

== User Interface ==

=== How can I dial my contacts over IP / over PSTN? ===

In settings you can specify your preferred call type. This is used when clicking a "Call" tab of a contact. When clicking on the "Text" tab of a contact you get a menu like this:

http://sipdroid.googlecode.com/svn/images/choose.png

"Messaging" lets you proceed with sending SMS/MMS. The other two let you override your call type manually.

=== How can I dial a phone number over IP / over PSTN? ===

When entering a phone number in the dialer add a "+" sign to toggle call type. If your preferred call type is SIP adding a + behind the number calls over PSTN.

NOTE: Don't add anything to emergency numbers. They are always dialed over PSTN.

http://sipdroid.googlecode.com/svn/images/choose2.png

=== How are the buttons assigned? ===

Android reserves the green and red keys for the built-in dialer of the phone. So Sipdroid is controlled by the MENU and BACK buttons instead.

==== When ringing ====

Incoming SIP calls can be identified by the turquoise icon in the status bar. Pressing the MENU button answers the SIP call. Pressing the green call button answers the regular call.

==== While in call ====

Green call button: Toggle on-hold

BACK button: End call

=== How can I switch Sipdroid on and off? ===

You need to open Sipdroid's settings and uncheck "Use WLAN" to disable it.

=== How do I exclude certain numbers from Sipdroid? ===

Choose *Advanced Options* and enter your pattern in the *exclude pattern* field.
Numbers can be exluded by type and/or number.  
<br> Format is pattern,pattern,pattern...

To exclude by *phone type* you can enter single or combination of the three supported types:
<br>e.g. h,m,w or ho,mo,wo or home,mobile,work (excludes all home, mobile and work numbers)

To exclude by *numbers* enter any java regular expression:
<br>e.g. \A\+01 (excludes all numbers starting with +01).

To exclude by *both* phone type and number:
<br>e.g. m,1234 (exludes all mobile and numbers that contain 1234).

== SIP Providers ==

=== What SIP providers is Sipdroid compatible with? ===

Sipdroid runs standard SIP. For full interoperability register Sipdroid to [http://pbxes.org pbxes.org]. From there register your SIP accounts. 

Possible issues when registering directly to other SIP servers are:

 * Battery drain on 3G/EDGE,
 * No ringing,
 * Poor voice in send direction,
 * One way voice, or
 * No connection at all

*Private as well as public SIP servers are usually not made or properly configured for serving mobile clients. As you can see there is not just one issue. It's a bunch of adjustments to account for phones that are not plugged into a single network, are battery powered and Java based. So unless you are a developer we don't recommend spending much time in getting your plain-vanilla Asterisk box suited for Sipdroid. Instead register your Asterisk to PBXes, too.*

=== Gizmo ===

PBXes is interoperable with most SIP providers. One exception is Gizmo which does not allow PBXes to fork for incoming calls. Using Gizmo directly, without PBXes, would result in a *battery drain on 3G/EDGE standby* as mentioned above.

So if you want to use Gizmo and have a good battery performance, use it with PBXes and add a second provider to do the forking to your mobile number.

=== What advantages do I get by signing up for the Free Account at PBXes? ===

  * You can register several trunks to use multiple telephony service providers of your choice.
  * [http://pbxes.org pbxes.org] routes incoming calls over SIP and PSTN to you. If you are online you can take it as VoIP, if off line you can take it as GSM.

=== Which features are supported in Sipdroid? ===

Sipdroid presently supports basic call. All the typical PBX features are configured from the PC. This concept is much like the concept of Google's services that allow you e.g. to manage your calendar on the PC and access it remotely on your phone. The following features are provided by the Free Account on [http://pbxes.org pbxes.org]:

  * Change number format (e.g. convert the + codes)
  * Music on hold
  * Support of several modes for DTMF tones
  * Support for NAT (network address translation)
  * Simultaneous Outbound Calling
  * Screening anonymous callers

http://sipdroid.googlecode.com/svn/images/priv.png

  * Time-based routing for incoming calls
  * Call Transfer
  * Conferences
  * Video Reception (Video Transmission is supported by Sipdroid natively)
  * Publish location on webcall page

You get even more [http://pbxes.org/iptel_virtual-pbx.html features] on the paid accounts (e.g. Video Streaming, Call Recording, Handoff of calls between networks).

What is currently missing is Bluetooth and there are already some [http://code.google.com/p/sipdroid/issues/list ideas] for more enhancements.

=== How can I set up PBXes? ===

Please have a look at the [http://pbxes.org/community_e.php?display=wiki HELP section]. Under "Getting started" you find an introduction to the necessary steps. *It's all web based. No installation required.* First you create extension(s) and trunk(s). Perform an echo test by dialing `*`43. Then you add at least one inbound and one outbound route. The Android specific details can be found under "Fixed Mobile Convergence (FMC)".

The username to be entered in Sipdroid consists of account name, a dash ('-') and the extension number, e.g. "myuser-200". The password is that of the extension, not the password of your PBXes account.

== Android Applications ==

=== Latitude ===

We noticed that choppy voice on WLANs can be resolved by turning off Latitude within Google Maps/Latitude/Privacy. An alternative is uploading position to a webcall page in PBXes.

=== Netcounter ===

This is very nice to account your bandwidth usage on mobile networks. However, when you use WLANs you should not install the present version. It wakes the device too often thus draining the battery.

=== Ambient Light Sensor ===

This [http://www.cyrket.com/package/org.pbxes.light2 tool] is recommended to save battery. It uses the camera to adjust screen brightness.

=== ChompSMS ===

This is the equivalent to Sipdroid for SMS.
