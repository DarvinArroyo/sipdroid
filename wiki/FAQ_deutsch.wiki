== Einleitung ==

=== Was ist bei der Nutzung zu beachten? ===

Sipdroid erlaubt Ihnen die Auswahl, wo VoIP-Dienste genutzt werden sollen: Nur innerhalb von WLANs, in 3G- oder EDGE-Netzen. Wenn VoIP-Dienste auch außerhalb des eigenen WLANs mobil genutzt werden sollen, empfiehlt sich ein Blick in das Kleingedruckte des Mobilfunkvertrages:

In Deutschland untersagen die Anbieter häufig die mobile Nutzung von VoIP. Die Europäische Kommission prüft bereits, ob Mobilfunkanbieter gegen Wettbewerbsregeln verstoßen, wenn sie Telefonate per mobilem Internet (VoIP) verbieten.

Geeignet für die VoIP-Nutzung von unterwegs ist z.B. die Tarife

=== Welche Bedingungen gelten für Gewährleistung und Haftung? ===

Sipdroid wird kostenlos unter den Bedingungen der [http://www.gnu.de/documents/gpl.de.html allgemeinen öffentlichen GNU-Lizenz v3] veröffentlicht. Darüberhinaus befindet sich die Software noch in der Beta-Testphase, so daß derzeit durchaus noch Fehler und Inkompatibilitäten auftreten können.

=== Wie wirkt sich Sipdroid auf die Akkulaufzeit aus? (Bleibt die Internetverbindung ständig aktiv?) ===

Wenn [http://pbxes.de pbxes.de] genutzt wird, ist die Standbyzeit vergleichbar mit Systemen ohne Sipdroid im Hintergrund (wir haben ca. 3 Tage gemessen). Siehe [http://code.google.com/p/sipdroid/wiki/NewStandbyTechnique Artikel] für Hintergrundinfos.

=== Welche Datenmenge wird übertragen? ===

Sipdroid benutzt den G.711-Codec, der etwa 80 kBit/s in jede Richtung überträgt. Dies entspricht einer Datenmenge von 1.2 MB pro Minute. Videotelefonate benötigen etwa das Doppelte.

=== Wie wähle ich zwischen Handynetz und IP-Anrufen aus? ===

=== How can I dial my contacts over Sipdroid / over Phone? ===

In settings you can specify your preferred call type. This is used when clicking a "Call" tab of a contact. When clicking on the "Text" tab of a contact you get a menu like this:

http://sipdroid.googlecode.com/svn/images/choose.png

"Messaging" lets you proceed with sending SMS/MMS. The other two let you override your call type manually.

=== How can I dial a number over Sipdroid / over Phone? ===

When entering a phone number in the dialer add a "+" sign to toggle call type. If your preferred call type is Sipdroid adding a + behind the number calls over Phone.

NOTE: Don't add anything to emergency numbers. They are always dialed over Phone.

=== How can I dial a Skype ID? (Or any other SIP URI?) ===

==== From Contacts ====

When clicking on the "Chat" tab of a contact you get a menu like this:

http://sipdroid.googlecode.com/svn/images/choose3.png

Choosing Sipdroid makes a voice call to a PC over instant messaging.

Calling Skype users requires registering to PBXes. The callee needs to allow anonymous calls.

This also works for Google Talk, MSN, Yahoo, AIM, and ICQ users. All these recipients have to do is either invite user service@gtalk2voip.com (gtalk2voip@yahoo.com for Yahoo! Messenger) to his friend list, or submit his user id from [http://gtalk2voip.com/ gtalk2voip main page], to become reachable from Sipdroid.

If you want to call any other SIP URI add it to a contact as one of the two unsupported messengers, Jabber or QQ, and use above method to dial the SIP URI from contacts.

==== From Sipdroid window ====

You can enter SIP URIs into the "Called Party Address" field in Sipdroid. For calling Skype users enter the Skype name followed by @skype into "Called Party Address". Calling Skype users requires registering to PBXes. 

=== How are the buttons assigned? ===

Android reserves the red key for turning screen off and the green call button for answering a phone call. That's why they don't always work for Sipdroid, e.g. when screen is turned on the red key will first switch screen off, and then end call on another press.  The green button will not work for Sipdroid if there is a phone call ringing at the same time. In this case the green button will answer the GSM call.

That's why Sipdroid offers a sliding card. A call is off-hook if the card is at the top of the screen, and it is on-hook at the bottom. Just slide up to answer. Slide down to end call. If you want to reject an incoming call press the BACK button. The BACK button will always end call.

=== How can I modify phone numbers on the fly? Where is the prefix option? ===

The _prefix_ option has been replaced by a more generic and flexible _search & replace_ feature. The "search & replace" option, available in *Advanced Options*, has the following form: `<search>,<replace>`

`<search>` is a [http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/essential/regex/ Java regular expression] with one or more [http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/essential/regex/groups.html groups] which can be then use in `<replace>`

`<replace>` is a string with reference to group(s) from the `<search>` field.

If the regular expression is not valid or the format is wrong, the original number is used.

Examples:

|| _Search & Replace_ || _Description_ ||
|| `\+41(.*),0041\1` || replace +41791111111 with 0041791111111 ||
|| `(.*),123\1` || add 123 in front of the number (prefix) ||
|| `(.*),\1123` || add 123 at the end of the number (postfix) ||

=== How do I exclude certain numbers from Sipdroid? ===

Choose *Advanced Options* and enter your pattern in the *exclude pattern* field.
Numbers can be exluded by type and/or number.  
<br> Format is pattern,pattern,pattern...

To exclude by *phone type* you can enter single or combination of the three supported types:
<br>e.g. h,m,w or ho,mo,wo or home,mobile,work (excludes all home, mobile and work numbers)

To exclude by *numbers* enter any java regular expression:
<br>e.g. \A\+01 (excludes all numbers starting with +01).

To exclude by *both* phone type and number:
<br>e.g. m,1234 (exludes all mobile and numbers that contain 1234).

=== What is "Trigger Callback/Callthru"? ===

Suppose you are outside your wireless LAN, or got a mobile Internet connection, but not good enough for a SIP call. Normally the dialer would fall back to Phone in this case.

  * Enabling "trigger callback" will instead ask the PBX to initiate a callback to your mobile number, and connect the call to the dialed contact.
    * This makes sense if you like the PBX features (like calling a SIP URI, simultaneous outbound, etc.), or if it's cheaper than a call from your mobile. I was using the function while roaming with a local SIM card. Some plans also allow you to get unlimited calls from a certain number. That number could be assigned to your PBX.

  * Enabling "trigger callthru" will call a PBX's trunk/DID (or any other calling card platform), dial PIN & destination number as DTMF tones, and connect you.
    * This is nice if you have unlimited minutes to a certain number or nationwide, and want to use them to dial out or dial internationally.

Exclude pattern and search & replace get applied in the same way as for SIP calls.

=== What types of video calls are supported? ===

There are three levels of operation for video calls.

==== Sending ====
By pressing the MENU button and choosing "Send Video" you can start
video transmission to a SIP phone with video.

==== Receiving ====
This is not supported natively. If you are registered to PBXes and the
other party starts sending video it will show up on the Android phone.

==== Streaming ====
When you start sending video as described in 1) while you are in a
call to a regular phone, and you have a PBXes Premium Account, the
other party can open your webcall URL, click on your photo and see
your video.

== SIP Providers ==

=== What SIP providers is Sipdroid compatible with? ===

Sipdroid runs standard SIP. For full interoperability register Sipdroid to [http://pbxes.org pbxes.org]. From there register your SIP accounts. 

Possible issues when registering directly to other SIP servers are:

 * Battery drain on 3G/EDGE,
 * Unreliable incoming calls,
 * Poor voice in send direction,
 * One way voice, or
 * No connection at all

*As you can see there is not just one issue. When Nokia released its SIP client in 2006 PBXes were the first to support it. It's a bunch of adjustments to account for phones that are not plugged into a single network, are battery powered and Java based. So unless you are a developer we don't recommend spending much time in getting your plain-vanilla Asterisk box suited for Sipdroid. Instead register your Asterisk to PBXes, too.*

For the future it is expected that SIP providers will become more interoperable (see also [http://code.google.com/p/sipdroid/wiki/NewStandbyTechnique article]). As Sipdroid is a true open source project attracting many software developers, the application and its documentation will be updated as more information gets available.

=== What advantages do I get by signing up for the Free Account at PBXes? ===

  * You can register several trunks to use multiple telephony service providers of your choice.
  * [http://pbxes.org pbxes.org] routes incoming calls over Sipdroid or Phone to you. If you are online you get them over VoIP, if off line you get them over GSM.

=== Which features are supported in Sipdroid? ===

Sipdroid presently supports basic call. All the typical PBX features are configured from the PC. This concept is much like the concept of Google's services that allow you e.g. to manage your calendar on the PC and access it remotely on your phone. The following features are provided by the Free Account on [http://pbxes.org pbxes.org]:

  * Change number format (e.g. convert the + codes)
  * Music on hold
  * Support of several modes for DTMF tones
  * Support for NAT (network address translation)
  * Simultaneous Outbound Calling
  * Screening anonymous callers

http://sipdroid.googlecode.com/svn/images/priv.png

  * Time-based routing for incoming calls
  * Call Transfer
  * Conferences
  * Video Reception (Video Transmission is supported by Sipdroid natively)
  * Trigger callback or callthru (if no suitable data network available)
  * Calls to Skype users

You get even more [http://pbxes.org/iptel_virtual-pbx.html features] on the paid accounts (e.g. Video Streaming, Announce Location, Call Recording, Improved Audio, Handoff of calls between networks).

What is currently missing is Bluetooth and there are already some [http://code.google.com/p/sipdroid/issues/list ideas] for more enhancements.

=== How can I set up PBXes? ===

Please have a look at the [http://pbxes.org/community_e.php?display=wiki HELP section]. Under "Getting started" you find an introduction to the necessary steps.

*It's all web based. No installation required.*

First you create extension(s) and trunk(s). Perform an echo test by dialing `*`43. Then you add at least one inbound and one outbound route. Leave the trunk name empty on your inbound route. The Android specific details can be found under "Fixed Mobile Convergence (FMC)".

The username to be entered in Sipdroid consists of account name, a dash ('-') and the extension number, e.g. "myuser-200". The password is that of the extension, not the password of your PBXes account.

== Android Applications ==

=== Ambient Light Sensor ===

This [http://www.cyrket.com/package/org.pbxes.light2 tool] is recommended to save battery. It uses the camera to adjust screen brightness.

=== Battery Hours ===

Another [http://www.cyrket.com/package/org.pbxes.eta tool] which measures and displays your remaining standby time.

=== ChompSMS ===

This is the equivalent to Sipdroid for SMS.

=== Google Talk ===

See [http://code.google.com/p/sipdroid/wiki/FAQ#How_can_I_dial_a_Skype_ID?_(Or_any_other_SIP_URI?) above]

=== GV ===

Sipdroid can be used to add true VoIP calling to the GV app. Both integrate amazingly well. Further info is available at [http://iiordanov.blogspot.com/2009/07/sipdroid-gv-guava.html Iordans's blog].

=== Latitude ===

We noticed that choppy voice on WLANs can be resolved by turning off Latitude within Google Maps/Latitude/Privacy. An alternative is uploading position to PBXes and announcing it to contacts when they call you.

=== Netcounter ===

This is very nice to account your bandwidth usage on mobile networks. However, when you use WLANs only you should not install the present version. It wakes the device too often thus draining the battery.
